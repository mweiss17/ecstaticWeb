        <br>

        

        <p>Silent Disco Squad aims to bring the transformational power of the dancefloor into everyday moments by organizing massively public, participant-driven Silent Disco Squads. 
          SDS uses mp3 players, smartphones and headphones to create a shared music experience for all participants, transforming everyday moments into a silent disco dance party. </p>

        <h1>Participant Driven</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Dance track suggestions are submitted ahead of time to the SDS Organizer. The organizer picks songs and uses the selection to make a crowdsourced dance mix. 
          Participants Bring their own Headphones and music players --> BYOD (Bring your own device) </p>

        <br>
        <p>The Mix is distributed ahead of time as mp3 and loaded to Soundcloud. We meet up at a certain time and place and countdown "3,2,1!"
          We hit play as the crowdsourced dance mix starts to stream. We all listen to the same music at the same time.</p>
